We had a powerful platform that developers could use to build and deploy their whole stack \u2014 from frontend to backend to database \u2014 and allowing them to manage multiple environments from development to staging to production. But they were not able to use it without the team\u2018s guidance.\nAfter years of effort, we realized that developers do not care for stability or desire complex features. Developers need simplicity in the world of Kubernetes. In our case, developers just want to deploy a repository. That\u2019s it, really! KintoHub ended up being the exact same problem as the problem it was trying to solve\u2026 A super promising technology but extremely complex to try so people just give up? 10 letters?

That basic rule is why the team has been motivated and inspired to make Kubernetes easy for developers this entire time. Basically, if Kubernetes is a platform for DevOps engineers, then KintoHub would be a platform for developers."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"But during the next 6 months, we strategically decided to build a SaaS solution while developing our codebase to be simple, clean, and ready to be open-sourced at some point. The hard reality caught up with us when we realized it won\u2019t be possible to juggle both a SaaS and open source simultaneously and we opted, as a business, to focus on users versus GitHub stars. KintoHub 1.0 was our last attempt at creating a SaaS platform and getting as many users as possible with a primary key performance indicator (KPI) to get as many users to successfully deploy their repositories."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"This led the team to build features allowing users to register and sign in to their account, allowing them to deploy their service into different regions, allowing them to directly connect to Github, etc. But while all those features are great for a SaaS platform, they add unnecessary complexity to an open-source developer tool."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"But it worked, users registered and successfully deployed their repositories on KintoHub!

In the last few weeks, we worked hard on cleaning and removing all the unnecessary stuff mentioned around our SaaS solution and created something easily deployable on any Kubernetes clusters, and immediately usable by any developer. KintoHub has never been so simple. In a few clicks, you can create a dedicated environment, connect your git repository and start deploying backend APIs, frontend websites, jobs, and workers.
